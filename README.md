[Aspose.OCR Cloud](https://products.aspose.cloud/ocr/) is an optical character recognition as a service. With it, you can easily add OCR functionality to almost any device or platform, including netbooks, mini PCs, or even entry-level smartphones.

Our engine can read text from images, photos, screenshots and scanned PDFs in a wide variety of European, Cyrillic and Oriental fonts, returning results in the most popular document formats. Powerful built-in image processing filters based on neural networks automatically correct skewed and distorted images, automatically remove dirt, smudges, scratches, glare and other image defects that can affect recognition accuracy. To further improve the results, Aspose.OCR Cloud has a built-in spell checker that automatically replaces misspelled words and saves you the trouble of manually correcting the recognition results.

Even the complex recognition tasks can be done with a couple of API calls. To make interacting with Aspose.OCR Cloud services from .NET applications even easier, we provide the software development kit (SDK) for .NET. It handles all the routine operations such as establishing connections, sending API requests, and parsing responses, wrapping all these tasks into a few simple classes.

Aspose.OCR Cloud SDK for .NET is open source under the MIT license. You can freely use it for any projects, including commercial and proprietary applications, as well as modify any part of its code.

## Get started

Aspose.OCR Cloud is an on-demand service with a free tier. In order to use Aspose.OCR Cloud service, you must create an account at **Aspose Cloud API**:

1. Go to https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/
2. If you are already registered with Aspose, sign in with your user name and password.  
   Otherwise, click **Donâ€™t have an account? Sign Up** link and create a new account.

Aspose values your privacy and takes technical, security and organizational measures to protect your data from unauthorized use, accidental loss or disclosure. Read our [Privacy Policy](https://about.aspose.cloud/legal/privacy-policy) and [Terms of Service](https://about.aspose.cloud/legal/tos) for details.

### Authorization

Aspose.OCR Cloud follows industry standards and best practices to keep your data secure. All communication with OCR REST API is done using JWT authentication, which provides an open-standard, highly secure way to exchange information. Time-limited JWT tokens are generated using _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_ credentials that are specific for each application. To obtain the credentials:

1. Sign in to [Aspose Cloud API Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/).
2. Go to [**Applications**](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/applications) page.
3. Click **Create New Application** button.
4. Give the application an easily recognizable name so it can be quickly found in a long list, and provide an optional detailed description.
5. Create the cloud storage by clicking the _plus_ icon and following the required steps. You can also reuse existing storage, if available.   
   Aspose.OCR Cloud uses its own internal storage, so you can provide the bare minimum storage options:

    - Type: **Internal storage**
    - Storage name: _Any name you like_
    - Storage mode: **Retain files for 24 hours**

6. Click **Save** button.
7. Click the newly created application and copy the values from **Client Id** and **Client Secret** fields.
8. Pass in the values from the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** fields when initializing the required OCR API.

### Running demo

1. Check out the SDK or install it from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.OCR-Cloud/).
2. Open [Examples](/src/Examples) demo solution.
3. Provide your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** (see _Authorization_ above).
4. Run the project.
